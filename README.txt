MidpSSH is an SSH and Telnet client for MIDP 1.0 / 2.0
devices such as Java(tm)-capable cellphones.

MidpSSH is based upon Floyd SSH and Telnet Floyd by
Radek Polak (http://phoenix.inf.upol.cz/~polakr/).

Floyd SSH and Telnet Floyd are ports of the Java(tm)
Telnet/SSH Applet (javassh.org) to the MIDP platform.

Floyd SSH and Telnet Floyd (and hence MidpSSH) includes
sources from Matthias L. Jugel, Marcus Meiﬂner (javassh.org)
and also the GNU Classpath project.

MidpSSH has been enhanced from Floyd SSH including:
* integration of Telnet and SSH into the one midlet;
* user interface development;
* refactoring and bug fixes;
